// Batch runs fn over every item with bounded concurrency. It is built on
// errgroup.WithContext, so the first non-nil error cancels the derived context
// and Batch returns that error once the in-flight calls observing the
// cancellation have unwound.
//
// stash-box is a shared, community-run service, so a read client must keep its
// fan-out bounded: pass a small positive limit to cap concurrent requests rather
// than hammering the endpoint. A limit of n>0 caps the number of concurrent
// calls. A limit of zero or less is treated as unbounded: every item runs
// concurrently. That is intentional — callers pass <=0 to opt out of throttling —
// so guard the limit yourself if an unbounded fan-out would be a bug for your
// input sizes (and it usually is, against a public stash-box).
//
// Cancellation: when the parent ctx is cancelled (or the first error cancels the
// derived ctx), Batch stops submitting further items promptly. Work already in
// flight is only short-circuited if fn observes ctx — fn must select on or
// otherwise honour ctx.Done() for a cancelled batch to unwind quickly; a fn that
// ignores ctx runs to completion regardless.
//
// A panic in fn is recovered and returned as an error (carrying the recovered
// value and the stack of the panicking goroutine) rather than crashing the
// process; like any error, it cancels the derived ctx.
//
// There is deliberately no retry. A well-behaved client must not mask a failure:
// when an operation fails, the caller learns about it rather than having the
// library silently try again.
