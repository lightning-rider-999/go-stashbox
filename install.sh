#!/bin/sh
# install.sh — install the go-stashbox `stashbox` CLI on Linux or macOS.
#
# Usage (the headline path):
#
#   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightning-rider-999/go-stashbox/main/install.sh | sh
#
# This downloads the correct release archive for your OS/arch from GitHub
# Releases, verifies its sha256 against the published checksums.txt, extracts the
# `stashbox` binary, and installs it into a directory on (or addable to) your PATH.
#
# Environment overrides:
#
#   VERSION=v1.2.3   pin a specific release tag (default: the latest release)
#   INSTALL_DIR=...  install into this directory (default: /usr/local/bin, with a
#                    sudo or ~/.local/bin fallback when it is not writable)
#
# This is a curl|sh installer, so the shebang above is ignored and the script is
# interpreted by whatever `sh` is on the user's box. It is therefore strict
# POSIX sh: no bashisms (no [[ ]], no arrays), `set -eu`, everything quoted.
#
# Windows is not a curl|sh target. On Windows use:
#   go install github.com/lightning-rider-999/go-stashbox/cmd/stashbox@latest
# or download a .zip from the Releases page.

set -eu

# Enable pipefail when the running shell supports it (bash, dash with the
# option, ksh, zsh, busybox ash). It is not in POSIX `sh`, so guard it: the
# subshell test keeps a shell that lacks the option from aborting under `set -e`.
# With pipefail on, a failed `fetch` upstream of a pipe (e.g. a 404 piped into
# the JSON parser) surfaces instead of being hidden by the last stage's success.
# shellcheck disable=SC3040  # pipefail is non-POSIX; the probe below gates it.
