// Package exitcode is the single source of truth for the CLI's frozen exit-code
// taxonomy: a stable name paired with the process exit status it carries. Both
// sides of the codebase derive from it — the CLI runtime (cmd/stashbox, which
// exits with these integers and stamps the name into the error envelope's "code"
// field) and the catalog generator (internal/gen, which feeds these names to
// github.com/trackness/graphql-opgen, emitted into schema/catalog.json for an
// agent to read). Sourcing both from here means the
// catalog's vocabulary and the runtime's exit codes cannot drift: a rename or
// renumber is one edit, locked by TestTaxonomyFrozen.
//
// The (name, integer) pairs are FROZEN. Never renumber an existing code; agents,
// schema/catalog.json, and docs/AGENTS.md depend on the exact values.
//
// go-stashbox is a READ-ONLY stash-box client: it exposes no mutation, no
// destructive operation, and no job-returning operation. The destructive,
// job, and confirmation codes (destructive-refused, job-failed, still-running,
// unconfirmed) are therefore part of the shared taxonomy — kept verbatim so the
// vocabulary stays identical across the sibling clients and the genops
// ExitCodeProvider can reference them by name — but they are never emitted by
// this client.
//
// This package deliberately imports nothing from the rest of the module, so it
// can sit underneath both consumers without an import cycle.
